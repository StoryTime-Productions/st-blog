## Welcome to the ./dev blog!

<div class="game-dev-highlight">
Greetings from Montreal! We're StoryTime Productions, an indie game development studio passionate about creating immersive Unity experiences. This blog is our window into the development process - sharing technical insights, creative challenges, and the unique perspective of building games from Canada's cultural hub.

### What We're Building

Our current focus spans multiple exciting projects:

- 🚇 **Prochaine Station** - A psychological horror adventure transforming Montreal's metro into an unsettling journey
- 🧟 **Zombie Runner** - Fast-paced survival action with strategic combat systems  
- 🚀 **ArgonAssault** - Space combat with precision controls and immersive environments
- 🏰 **RealmRush** - Medieval tower defense with strategic depth

### Our Development Philosophy

<div class="montreal-accent">
We believe in open development, community collaboration, and sharing knowledge. Every technical challenge we overcome, every creative breakthrough we achieve, and every lesson we learn becomes part of our shared contribution to the indie game development community.

As students and developers from diverse backgrounds - engineering, computational arts, multimedia - we bring unique perspectives to every project. Our Montreal location gives us access to a rich bilingual culture that influences our game design and narrative approaches.
