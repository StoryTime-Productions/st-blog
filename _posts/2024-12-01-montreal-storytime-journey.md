Bonjour from the beautiful city of Montreal! üçÅ As we launch our official dev blog, we wanted to share the story behind StoryTime Productions and what drives us to create immersive gaming experiences from Canada's cultural hub.

## Our Montreal Roots

<div class="montreal-accent">
Montreal isn't just our location‚Äîit's our inspiration. This vibrant, bilingual city with its rich cultural tapestry, harsh winters, and thriving creative scene shapes everything we do. From the metro tunnels that inspired Prochaine Station to the diverse communities that inform our game narratives, Montreal is woven into the DNA of our studio.

- **Affordable Living**: Lower costs of living compared to other major tech hubs
- **Creative Community**: A thriving indie game scene with regular meetups and game jams

## Our Development Philosophy

<div class="game-dev-highlight">
We believe great games come from authentic experiences. Our team of students and creators from diverse backgrounds‚Äîengineering, computational arts, multimedia‚Äîbrings fresh perspectives to every project. We're not just making games; we're crafting interactive stories that resonate with players worldwide.
